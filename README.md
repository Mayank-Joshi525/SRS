Laundry Management System
Introduction
Welcome to the Laundry Management System project! In our college, the laundry process is currently managed manually, leading to inefficiencies and delays. To address this issue and bring the laundry service into the digital age, we are developing a comprehensive Laundry Management System.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing laundry services within our college. By digitizing the laundry management process, we aim to streamline operations, improve user experience, and enhance overall efficiency.

Scope
The Laundry Management System will serve as a centralized platform for students and staff to submit laundry requests, track order statuses, and manage inventory. It will include features such as user registration, laundry request submission, order management, inventory tracking, and notification alerts.

Key Features
User Registration and Authentication: Users can register for accounts and log in securely to access the system.
Laundry Request Submission: Users can submit laundry requests, specifying details such as laundry type, preferences, and pickup/delivery timings.
Order Management: Administrators can manage incoming laundry requests, assign tasks, and track order statuses.
Inventory Tracking: The system will keep track of laundry supplies and equipment, ensuring optimal inventory levels.
Notification Alerts: Users will receive real-time notifications regarding order confirmations, status updates, and completion alerts.
Technologies Used
The project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase for backend services. The combination of these technologies ensures a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution.

Next Steps
We are committed to delivering a high-quality Laundry Management System that meets the needs of our college community. Our team is currently in the development phase, focusing on implementing core features and ensuring seamless user experience. Stay tuned for updates and announcements as we progress towards the launch of the system!
